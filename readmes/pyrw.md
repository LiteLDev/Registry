Here is the official website of [BDSpyrunnerW](https://github.com/WillowSauceR/BDSpyrunnerW/ "Github page"), BDSpyrunnerW is a branch of BDSpyrunner, because the original project chose to rely on the richer API of LL and gave up independent development, the positioning of this branch is lightweight, to meet the requirements of the survival suit micro-change (play recommended to [addons](https://mcpedl.com/ "find addons"), to maintain the independence of the project to continue to maintain the branch The API is not much, but we will try to ensure the high performance and stability of the plug-in. We add ``W`` after the original name ``BDSpyrunner`` to distinguish the main branch version using [LiteLoaderAPI](https://github.com/LiteLDev/LiteLoaderBDS/). This branch version is based on the main branch [Release1.8.7](https://github.com/twoone-3/BDSpyrunner/tree/f7645c3e69bf505d4207f76932c28665fff576fe "Github page"), which was the last commit version of BDSpyrunner before it switched to using ``LiteLoaderAPI``. This branch focuses on stability, so the API and listeners are not as rich as the main branch, so please pay attention to the listener and API versions used by your plugin when using it
